				<h3>Experiment</h3>
				<p>
					To begin, create a unique username and password, ensuring that the username is short and in lowercase letters. Please type the given sentence 60 or more times at a comfortable, natural pace. It's important to note that the data stored is not encrypted, so please refrain from using any personal information in your username and password. To maintain consistency, use the same username and password for all your entries. Lastly, be attentive to typing only correct characters, and the data will automatically submit upon the completion of each iteration.
				</p>
				<p>It is not necessary to complete this in one sitting.</p>
